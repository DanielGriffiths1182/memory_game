```

Push up changes and submit pull request in GitHub:

Inside of GitHub repo, click on pull request. Send the link of the pull request to the group slack channel, and ask for ðŸ‘€. If there are no merge conflicts, then push changes to origin master. If there **are** conflicts, please keep reading.
